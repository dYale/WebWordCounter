# Word Counter

##Purpose
Ever get to a web page and find yourself seeing the same words over and over again. Now we have an app that takes a URL and counts every word and character on the webpage!

### Getting Started

Fork the repo to your own GitHub account. If you do not have a GitHub account, then this is a great time to make one!

```
$ git clone https://github.com/{your username}/PreCourseChallenge
$ cd PreCourseChallenge
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm start
```

Now visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)
